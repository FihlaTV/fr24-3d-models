# Contribute

Contributions are always welcome!  Feel free to open pull requests for any 3D aircraft models or house liveries, as long as they are licensed under free license (GPLv2, BSD, etc...). 

## 3D Models
You can contribute missing 3d models by posting pull request with model (.blend, .obj,.dae or .gltf extension) and providing details about it and license info.

gltf extension is preferred, since not all .blend/.obj/.dae models correctly converts to [glTF format](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF). To check conversion, please use [online converter from dae to glTF](https://cesiumjs.org/convertmodel.html). Also, you can use various [other converters](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF#converters)

## Liveries
We are currently looking for house liveries for most of aircrafts. All of [FGMEMBERS](https://github.com/FGMEMBERS) aircrafts  contains paintkits, which you can use as a template for a livery([example](https://github.com/FGMEMBERS/737-800/tree/master/Paintkit)). 

Please note that we are currently not looking for airlines liveries.
